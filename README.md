# youCanHarp

This project was built in C++ using the openFrameworks toolkit.
I wanted to build an application to introduce people (musicians and non) to the harp, the instrument I play, and perhaps learn a bit more about how music scales work.
Thanks to the simplicity of my app, the user is able to create melodies that are in tune, relaxing and pleasing without having a great musical knowledge.
In my application the user can select the scale they want to use.
When a scale is selected the notes in the scale will be displayed as colours.
After the user has selected a note/colour they will be able to add objects that will bounce off the edges playing the sample that correspond to that particular note/colour.
